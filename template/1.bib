  abstract = {Plant biology is becoming a data-driven science. High-throughput technologies generate data quickly from molecular to ecosystem levels. Statistical and computational approaches enable describing and interpreting data quantitatively. We highlight the purpose, common problems, and general principles in data analysis. We use RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis to illustrate the rationale behind some of the choices made in statistical data analysis. Finally, we provide a list of free online resources that emphasize intuition behind quantitative data analysis.},

Now the big data occupies much attention in some extent for his volume, velocity, and variety. But in practical use the value plays more important role. Finally to judge the value for data not necessary for big, in some cases the small data also may lead to big value. So we appreciate the data science, which may consider more inherent value from data.},

  abstract = {It is already true that Big Data has drawn huge attention from researchers in information sciences, policy and decision makers in governments and enterprises. As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore’s Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.},

The method is not only applicable to traditional sentiment lexicons, but also to more comprehensive, multi-dimensional affective resources such as SenticNet. It comprises the following steps: (i) identify ambiguous sentiment terms, (ii) provide context information extracted from a domain-specific training corpus, and (iii) ground this contextual information to structured background knowledge sources such as ConceptNet and WordNet. A quantitative evaluation shows a significant improvement when using an enriched version of SenticNet for polarity classification. Crowdsourced gold standard data in conjunction with a qualitative evaluation sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of the concept grounding, and on the quality of the enrichment process.},

The financial data classification standard, which always performs excellently in these aspects, is an essential premise for data mining and analysis in the big data2. To find a method to form the classification standard framework that can meet diverse purposes is very important. This research proposes a way to form the framework of financial data classification standard based on uniform classification standard and relative books, improved by comparing with classification standard of existed financial database and verified by practice with financial data sources. This framework can adapt to trends in the era of the big data and improve data storage mode.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of digital media in daily life has resulted in a need for novel multimedia data analysis techniques. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) solves problems using the already stored knowledge, and captures new knowledge, making it immediately available for solving the next problem. Therefore, case-based reasoning can be seen as a method for problem solving, and also as a method to capture new experience and make it immediately available for problem solving. Therefore, CBR can mine sparse and big data. It can be seen as a learning and knowledge-discovery approach, since it can capture from new experience some general knowledge, such as case classes, prototypes and some higher-level concept.  In this talk, we will explain the case-based reasoning process scheme. We will show what kinds of methods are necessary to provide all the functions for such a computer model. We will develop the bridge between CBR and Statistics and show how case- based reasoning can mine big and sparse data. Examples are being given based on multimedia applications. Finally, we will show recent new developments and we will give an outline for further work.},
